# To-Do List

### To Do
- [ ] Improve file and directory handling in Python
- [ ] Make use of Scratch folder for ORCA in order to prevent piling up of temporary files
- [ ] Scrape data immediately after finishing of ORCA compound job: put relevant data into one output file (e.g., energies)
- [ ] Switch over to using input files for all ***REMOVED***ps
- [ ] Switch over to using ORCA for all ***REMOVED***ps
  - [ ] Investigate possibility of using NEB
- [ ] Implement three-point TS search to allow search for higher-energy mechanisms
- [ ] Add option to perform conformational analysis at before TS search

- [ ] Investigate possibility to first find TS and then apply substitutions 

### In Progress :)
- [ ] Include data collector tool

### Completed âœ“
- [x] Clean up pysisyphus/qm_calcs folder after completion
- [x] Fix fragment combiner (RDKit)
